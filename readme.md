# Modbus Communication with python and pyModbusTCP

[Modbus](https://modbus.org/) is a serial communication protocol that is oftenly being used with programmable logic controllers or PLC. This method of exhcanhing information between various electronic devices consists of a Modbus server (providing the data) and a Modbus client (requesting them). There are two versions of the Modbus protocol, one for serial lines (such as RTU and ASCII) and for ethernet.

For developement purposes, it is often needed to emulate streaming data generated by different measurement devices or sensors. Here, a modbus TCP server is implemented in python using the [*pyModbusTCp*](https://pypi.org/project/pyModbusTCP/) library. The python script reads (row-by-row) the measurements recorded in a csv file from the simulation of a distribution power system and updates periodically the registers of the Modbus server:

```python
from pyModbusTCP.server import ModbusServer

server = ModbusServer("0.0.0.0", 12345, no_block=True)
```

The above snippet is from the [server.py](./server.py) showing the instantatiation of a ModbusServer running at 0.0.0.0:12345. To verify that the server is working properly, a [test_client.py](./test_client.py) has been developed that reads and printe periodically the registers of the modbus server.
